# JavaScript Divide by Zero Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: attempting to divide by zero. The code includes a `divide` function that throws an error when the divisor is zero, highlighting the importance of error handling when performing arithmetic operations.  The solution demonstrates a more robust approach using try-catch blocks to handle the error gracefully.
